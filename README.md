👋 Hi, I'm Jena

I'm a Security Engineer and creative technologist building at the intersection of AI, automation, and cyber defense. Whether it's scaling machine learning pipelines, breaking down phishing threats, or crafting educational content that actually sticks — I'm here to build things that matter.

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- 🎥 Building an automated ML explainer video pipeline using OpenAI + SORA
- 🛡️ Developing phishing classifiers with AWS Comprehend + Terraform
- 🎙️ Running a daily AI news segment: [Need-to-Nerd Basis](#) (stay tuned!)
- 🔍 Comparing SIEM platforms for high-ingest, security-first environments

## 📂 Projects at a Glance

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of — blending creativity, security, and scale:

- **ML Social Video Pipeline** – AI → storyboard → video → social post
- **Phishing Detection Engine** – Custom classifiers, AWS automation, RL on the horizon
- **AI News Synthesizer** – Daily editorial news scripts for podcast + TikTok
- **CMMC Compliance Planner** – Real-world cost breakdowns for cert readiness
